# Privacy Policy for Claude UI Shortcuts

## Overview
Claude UI Shortcuts is a Chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to the Claude AI interface (claude.ai). This privacy policy explains our data handling practices.

## Data Collection
This extension:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT store any user data on external servers
- Does NOT track user behavior or browsing history
- Only processes keyboard inputs locally to enable shortcut functionality
- Only operates within the claude.ai domain

## Data Usage
The only data handling that occurs is:
1. Processing keyboard combinations locally to trigger shortcuts
2. All processing happens entirely within your browser
3. No data is transmitted to any external servers

## Data Storage
The extension uses Chrome's local storage API solely to:
- Store keyboard shortcut configurations
- This data never leaves your browser

## Permissions Explanation
The extension requires minimal permissions:
- `storage`: For saving shortcut configurations locally
- `tabs`: To detect if you're on claude.ai and enable shortcuts
- `activeTab`: To interact with Claude's interface
- `https://claude.ai/*`: To implement shortcuts on Claude's website
